# Connect Four Project
authors: Jerald Stephenson, Benjamin Peto
**Version 1.0.0**



This is a collaberative project aimed at recreating the popular Connect Four game for web browsers.


This project is to facilitate our learning of HTML, CSS and JavaScript as build the project and work through any issues. Since it is also a collaborative effort, it allows the opportunity to work with other learning developers in a professional capacity to improve our soft-skills such as communication. This project is meant to grow in scope as we learn more technologies and features will be updated to reflect our new knowledge.
